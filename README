= Deadlock Retry

Deadlock retry allows the database adapter (currently only tested with the
MySQLAdapter) to retry transactions that fall into deadlock. It will retry
such transactions five times before finally failing.

This capability is automatically added to ActiveRecord. No code changes or otherwise are required.

== Installation

Add it to your application's Gemfile:

  gem 'deadlock_retry', :git => 'git://github.com/kajic/deadlock_retry.git'
